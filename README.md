The idea of an unconference is to form a programme together \
🤝 Please post ideas for sessions as [issues](https://github.com/DKRZ-AIM/HAI-HI-unconference-2023/issues). You need to have a GitHub account in order to do so.

💡  Feel free to start a rough description of your idea as a new git issue and discuss with potential collaborators.

📜 **Rule 1:** One issue per potential unconference session\
🍒 Comment on existing issues if you have any thoughts or questions about it. You can also mention how you could contribute or anything else relevant to the idea.

📜 **Rule 2:** Use the unconference issue template to put your abstract in the right shape - we need information such as a session title, description, resonsible persons, timeframe and so on.

📜 **Rule 3:** Please make sure that your session ideas are understandable to everyone. We come from different fields. Use as little jargon as possible. 💁

🗣️ At the beginning of the unconference we will have an introduction session where all session organizers will have the chance to pitch their project idea and to guide people to their session. Prepare yourself for a <1min pitch.

👍 Please vote on project ideas/issues that you consider interessting.

📜 **Rule 4 After the unconference:** Please add a short summary about the outcome of your session to the open git issue, e.g., specify specific results, link to documents you worked on, specify goals for future collaboration you agreed on.

If you run into any problems with this process, please contact the program chairs [Angela Jurik-Zeiller](mailto:angela.jurik-zeiller@helmholtz-muenchen.de) and/or [Paul Jäger](mailto:p.jaeger@dkfz-heidelberg.de).
