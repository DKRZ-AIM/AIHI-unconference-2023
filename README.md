# Future Challenges: an Unconference 
Topic collection for the Unconference at the Helmholtz AI/Helmholtz Imaging conference joint day, June 14, 2023, Hamburg

üëâ For the conferences full programme visit [Helmholtz AI Conference 2023](https://helmholtzai-conference2023.de/) and 
[Helmholtz Imaging Conference 2023](https://events.hifis.net/event/573/)

The idea of an unconference is to form a programme together \
ü§ù Please post ideas for sessions as [issues](https://github.com/DKRZ-AIM/HAI-HI-unconference-2023/issues). You need to have a GitHub account in order to do so.

üí°  Feel free to start a rough description of your idea as a new git issue and discuss with potential collaborators.\
üìú **Rule 1:** One issue per potential unconference session\
üçí Comment on existing issues if you have any thoughts or questions about it. You can also mention how you could contribute or anything else relevant to the idea.

üìú **Rule 2:** At the end there should be an abstract addressing the following items.
* **Title**
* **Description**, pointing out, e.g.
    * Question to be addressed
    * Task to be solved
    * Final outcome or even product, e.g., a blog post, a draft for a white paper, an outline for a software prototype, a list of rules to follow, a list of answers to specific questions
* **Organizer(s)**
in best case also name a representative. Don't forget to add contact information, i.e. email or github ID
* **Speakers**, if applicable
In case the format foresees an introduction, short talks etc.
* **Format**
E.g., talks followed by open discussion, hackathon like format, world caf√©, etc. 
You can find a list of common unconference formats [here](http://unconference.net/methods-2/). But at the end its up to the organizers
* **Timeframe**
Specify the time you foresee for this session, e.g., 30min, 1h, ..., up to 3h
* **Number of participants**
Define the minimal number of participants you need to work on the specified task. 
Is there a limit to the number of people who attend this session?

üìú **Rule 3:** Please make sure that your session ideas are understandable to everyone. We come from different fields. Use as little jargon as possible. üíÅ

_**to be discussed**_
_We will review proposals in a two-stage process. On May 15 no more new issues are accepted. Until May 29 the existing proposals for sessions can still be discussed, merged, closed, or finalized. We will decide on the final program based on what we have after this second deadline._

If you run into any problems with this process, please contact the program chairs **[tbd](mailto:tbd) and/or [tbd](mailto:tbd)**.
