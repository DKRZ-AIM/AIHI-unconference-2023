The idea of an unconference is to form a programme together \
🤝 Please post ideas for sessions as [issues](https://github.com/DKRZ-AIM/HAI-HI-unconference-2023/issues). You need to have a GitHub account in order to do so.

💡  Feel free to start a rough description of your idea as a new git issue and discuss with potential collaborators.

📜 **Rule 1:** One issue per potential unconference session\
🍒 Comment on existing issues if you have any thoughts or questions about it. You can also mention how you could contribute or anything else relevant to the idea.

📜 **Rule 2:** Use the unconference issue template to put your abstract in the right shape - we need information such as a session title, description, resonsible persons, timeframe and so on.

📜 **Rule 3:** Please make sure that your session ideas are understandable to everyone. We come from different fields. Use as little jargon as possible. 💁

_**to be discussed**_
_We will review proposals in a two-stage process. On May 15 no more new issues are accepted. Until May 29 the existing proposals for sessions can still be discussed, merged, closed, or finalized. We will decide on the final program based on what we have after this second deadline._

If you run into any problems with this process, please contact the program chairs **[tbd](mailto:tbd) and/or [tbd](mailto:tbd)**.
